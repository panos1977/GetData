# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization. More specifically, this repo contains the R script called run_analysis.R and the code book called codebook.md.

## About the R script
Here, we describe how run_analysis.R script works.

1. First, download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
2. Unzip the file UCI HAR Dataset.zip and it must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".
3. Make sure the directory "UCI HAR Dataset" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
